# state-thoughts

A writeup of my thoughts on the current state model

## Todo

- Code up existing examples
- Look for more examples from the state example
- Write up my notes on why I did what I did
- Write up general principles I think are important for 
    - state
    - something to be "streamlit-y"
    - Why I no longer think we need state to be as carefully protected as
      before
- Read the objection doc they wrote. Write in my own thoughts
- Write an intro basically
    - We want to find the solution which makes the *most sense* to our users
    - We want to make it possible to write apps in the style of 
      data-transformation-like Python scripts
    - We want to use state as sparingly as possible
